\cvline{title}{\emph{Scheduling for Volunteer Computing on the BOINC Server Infrastructure}}
\cvline{supervisor}{A. Legrand}
\cvline{description}{\small In the race for higher performances on large-scale computations one
	resources that has remained untapped for long are the unused cycles on personal desktop computers.
	Volunteer Computing initiatives such as the BOINC project focus on the usage of this resource.
	However the evolution of the use-cases of this type of computing power requires additional
	research on how to schedule computational tasks on the available volunteer clients. Subjects such
	as fair resource sharing, batch completion and deadline specifications are at the core of this
	study.

\cvline{title}{\emph{High-performance Cryptography through Bitslice Implementation}}
\cvline{supervisor}{B. Dupont de D\^{i}nechin}
\cvline{description}{\small Growing bandwidths of network connections create challenges in
	high-speed and parallel cryptographic processing. The use of well-chosen instructions enables a
	cipher like the AES in a bitslice implementation to take advantage of the new wave of many-core
	architectures. This work presents a case study of both the theory and practice behind such an
	implementation.
